    1.1:Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction (3 lines on top of each other while being crossed out.) 
    <br>
    The equal input is only true when both of the inputs are true. The reason that the XOR operation uses that same symbol, but crossed out, is because XOR can be true if one value is true.
    <br>

    <br>
    The reason the formula for the number of rows is related only to the number of inputs is because there are only two possible inputs
