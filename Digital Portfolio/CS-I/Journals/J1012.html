    1.1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.
    <br>
    Line the digits vertically. Add the right coloumn together and carry any digit that is over what your adding. Repaeat process for every column until you don't carry anymore. The number at the bottom is your sum(answer)
    <br>
    2.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?
    <br>
    Because octal is only 8 digits we have to skip 8-9.
    <br>
    3.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?
    <br>
    In hexidecimal, there are many nukbers so any numbers after 10 are labeled A11, B12, C13, D14, E15, F16.
    <br>
    4.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?
    <br>
    In binary there are only 2 numbers: 1 and 0. If 1 and 1 are added it equals 10.
